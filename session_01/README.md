## 🚀 1. Introduction to Python

### 🔹 What is Python?
Python is a **high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language** known for its **simplicity and readability**.

### 🔹 Why Python for Data Science & Machine Learning?
- Huge library support (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- Easy to learn and write
- Widely used in industry and research

---

## 🧪 2. Google Colab & Jupyter Notebook

### 🔹 What is Google Colab?
Google Colab is a **free, cloud-based platform** that allows you to write and run Python code directly in your browser — no installation needed.

### 🔹 Why use Colab / Jupyter?
- Interactive coding environment
- Easy sharing and collaboration
- Perfect for Data Science experiments

---

## 🧩 3. Variables in Python

### 🔹 What is a Variable?
A variable is a **container that stores data values**.

### 🔹 Assigning a Variable
```python
x = 10
name = "Python"
🔹 Overwriting a Variable
x = 10
x = 20   # old value is replaced
print(x)
📌 Output:

20
🔢 4. Basic Data Types
Data Type	Example
Integer	10
Float	3.14
String	"Hello"
Boolean	True, False
Example:
age = 22
height = 5.8
language = "Python"
is_student = True
🖨️ 5. Printing Output
Use print() to display output.

print("Welcome to Python")
print(age)
✍️ 6. Comments in Python
Comments help explain code and are ignored during execution.
